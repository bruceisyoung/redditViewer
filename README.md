# redditViewer  
an awesome customed designed reddit viewer  
  
how to test this suite:  
1. fork the repo and git clone your repo;  
2. change directory into the repo;  
3. run scripts "npm install";  
4. run scripts "npm run dev";  
5. go to your web browser: type in "http://localhost:8080", and enter;  
  
notice:  
1. only the buttons on the left side is clickable, the button shapes on the tops only display what subreddits has been chosen and in the active state.  
2. sometimes the reddits api won't respond, just ctrl+r to refresh the page. it should be good.
